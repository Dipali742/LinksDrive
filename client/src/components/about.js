        LinksDrive is a powerful and easy to use web app 
        for seamlessly organizing the daily tasks of a user. 
         
The general idea is to break tasks down
into smaller and easier-to-handle chunks, come into perspective. 
Over time, as more and more
tasks need to be done we need a platform or drive similar to google, one drive, etc.
So LinksDrive is a drive with a private
repository for each user where they can add the links using 
a tagging system with some features
and a search engine that makes sorting of the desired data easier. 
      You know! Smart Idea always comes to well planners. 
       
      Explore in new support world! Itâ€™s now faster & quicker. 
     Taking a step towards operating with maximum efficiency 
     tomorrow by using a LinksDrive today!
